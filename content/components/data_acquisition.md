## Data Acquisition

Data acquisition is the foundational step in any Enterprise Perception System (EPS), involving the gathering of raw data from various sources—both machine-driven and human-driven. This data forms the foundation for perceptual analysis, decision-making, and the generation of insights. Historically, organizations primarily relied on human-generated data for decision-making, but with the advent of advanced sensors and automation technologies, machine-generated data has increasingly become the norm. The diversity of data sources, from automated sensors to human inputs, makes EPS flexible and adaptable in different contexts. This section will cover the types of data acquisition, the evolving role of both machines and humans as sensors, and the technologies that support this process.

### Types of Data Acquisition

Data acquisition in an EPS can be broadly categorized based on the nature of the data and the type of “sensor” collecting it. Both machines and humans contribute valuable data, though their methods of collection and the nature of their inputs differ. The balance between human-generated and machine-generated data in organizations has shifted dramatically in recent decades.

Human-Generated Data: The Traditional Approach

Historically, most enterprises and industries relied heavily on human-generated data to drive their decision-making processes. This was due in part to the lack of automated systems that could provide real-time data at scale. As a result, organizations were structured around human inputs, where observations, reports, and assessments were the primary sources of insight.

Examples include:

- Call notes and decriptions of events: In industries like security, retail, or logistics, human observers were often the only means of recording events or tracking interactions. A security officer would log an event in a report, or a sales associate would describe a customer’s experience.
- Manual reports or annotations: Workers in manufacturing or operations logged observations, incidents, and metrics manually. These reports captured qualitative nuances—like product defects or safety issues—that could be critical for decision-making.
- Surveys and forms: Feedback was often collected through structured forms or surveys, whether for employee performance evaluations, customer satisfaction, or compliance auditing. This method, while useful, often introduced delays and biases in the reporting process.

The Shift to Machine-Generated Data

With the advent of modern sensing technologies, organizations began shifting from reliance on human-generated data to machine-generated data. The rise of digital sensors, IoT devices, and automation systems enabled enterprises to collect data in real time, at a scale and speed that was previously impossible. Machine-generated data provided an objective, consistent, and often more reliable source of information, enabling more accurate and timely decision-making.

Examples include:

- Bluetooth tracking: Systems that detect the presence of a Bluetooth-enabled device when it enters a specific area. This has been widely adopted in retail, security, and even smart offices to automate location-based tracking without the need for manual logs.
- Temperature readings: Sensors in factories, warehouses, or even office buildings provide continuous environmental data, ensuring conditions like temperature, humidity, or air quality are within desired ranges.
- Motion detection: Cameras and motion sensors automatically detect and log physical movement in spaces like warehouses, hospitals, or smart cities, reducing the need for human surveillance and manual entry of data.
