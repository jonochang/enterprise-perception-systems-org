## Enterprise Perception System

An Enterprise Perception System (EPS) is a centralized platform that merges human expertise and AI capabilities to analyze data from various sources, and then to take the appropriate actions in the world. EPS provides a streamlined process for collecting, organizing, interpreting and taking actions upon this data. Whether the information comes from sensors, IoT devices, visual inputs like cameras, or text from online documents, EPS ensures the organisation can handle the volume of data coming into the enterprise and take the best course of action.

Just like how the GUI and desktop computers transformed how our organisations worked, EPS works with major technology trends such as low-cost sensors, ubiquitous access to the internet and Artificial Intelligence to transforms how businesses handle and interpret data. It accelerates perception analysis, enabling domain experts to collaborate with AI models to produce precise and timely insights, and enables faster decision making and actions to be taken.

### Why your organisation may need an Enterprise Perception System (EPS)

Many organizations gather vast amounts of perceptual data from sensors, cameras, IoT devices, and more. But making sense of this data and turning it into actionable insights is often a slow and fragmented process. Teams responsible for interpreting the data can become overwhelmed, leading to delayed decision-making. Whether you’re trying to manage assets, improve workflow efficiency, or drive innovation, relying solely on human analysis or isolated AI models can slow your ability to react to crucial changes within your organisation.

This is where an Enterprise Perception System (EPS) comes in. By integrating human intelligence and Artificial Intelligence (AI) within a centralized platform, EPS allows organizations to analyze and interpret perception data rapidly and efficiently. An EPS not only improves the quality of data assessments but also ensures that businesses can make informed decisions, providing the provenence and context for how the decision was made and the action taken.

With EPS, you can scale your data interpretation efforts across your entire enterprise by decentralizing workflows and empowering human and AI agents to collaborate on the data that matters most.

### Key Components of EPS

EPS comprises several interconnected subsystems, each designed to optimize data management and interpretation:

1. Data Collection

Gathers perceptual data from various sources—such as sensors, images, and videos—for processing and analysis. This subsystem ensures that raw data is capture about the world, and funneled into the system quickly and efficiently.

2. Schema

Tracks and organizes important data concepts through a structured hierarchy, ensuring that the most relevant information is easily accessible and interpretable by AI and human agents alike.

3. Assessment

Perform data analysis tasks, whether by human experts or automated AI agents.

4. Actions

Once a decision is made, take the appropriate action, whether by human experts or automated AI agents.

5. Agent Development & Deployment

Provides the tools necessary for training and deploying both human and machine agents to handle specific tasks.

6. Evaluation

Continuously monitors the performance of agents, assessing their accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.

7. Visualization

Produces detailed visual representations of data, such as charts, maps, and reports, helping users to interpret insights and make informed decisions.
